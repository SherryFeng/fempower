# fempower
HackDuke 2017
fempower is a platform built for females in industry to give and receive mentorship in a supportive, healthy, open community. From both personal experience and empirical evidence, we identified a lack of strong mentorship networks as a driving cause behind gender disparities in nearly all fields in which women are underrepresented. While current organizations exist to combat this trend, we wanted to create a platform where anyone could sign up to mentor or be mentored, and people could form more personal, proximate relationships with one another.
